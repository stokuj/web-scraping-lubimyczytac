# Refactoring Proposal: Converting to Object-Oriented Programming

## Current Code Structure

The current codebase is entirely procedural, with functions operating on data structures passed as parameters. The main components are:

1. **main.py** - Entry point and orchestration
2. **scraper package**
   - **book_details.py** - Extracts ISBN and original title from a book page
   - **profile_scraper.py** - Scrapes book data from a user's profile
   - **enrichment.py** - Enriches book data with ISBN and original titles
3. **table_utils.py** - Data processing and file operations

## Potential Classes and Relationships

Based on the analysis of the codebase, the following classes could be created:

1. **Book** - Represents a book with all its attributes
   - Properties: id, title, author, isbn, cycle, avg_rating, rating_count, readers, opinions, user_rating, book_link, read_date, shelves, self_shelves, original_title
   - Methods: to_dict(), from_dict(), to_goodreads_format()

2. **BookScraper** - Handles scraping book data from Lubimyczytac.pl
   - Methods: scrape_profile(profile_url), get_book_details(url)

3. **BookEnricher** - Enriches book data with additional information
   - Methods: enrich_books(books)

4. **BookRepository** - Handles saving and loading book data
   - Methods: save_to_csv(books, filename), load_from_csv(filename), convert_to_goodreads(input_file, output_file)

5. **ScraperApp** - Main application class that orchestrates the scraping process
   - Methods: run(), scrape_books(), load_books(), enrich_books(), save_books(), convert_to_goodreads()

## Applicable Design Patterns

Several design patterns could be applied to improve the code:

1. **Factory Pattern** - For creating different types of scrapers or repositories
   - Example: A ScraperFactory that creates different types of scrapers for different websites

2. **Strategy Pattern** - For different scraping or enrichment strategies
   - Example: Different strategies for extracting book details from different websites

3. **Singleton Pattern** - For ensuring only one instance of certain classes
   - Example: A single WebDriver instance shared across the application

4. **Repository Pattern** - For abstracting data access
   - Example: The BookRepository class that handles all data access operations

5. **Facade Pattern** - For providing a simplified interface to the complex subsystems
   - Example: The ScraperApp class that provides a simple interface to the scraping process

## Benefits of Refactoring to OOP

1. **Improved Code Organization** - Classes provide a natural way to organize code around data and behavior
2. **Better Encapsulation** - Data and behavior are encapsulated within classes, reducing global state
3. **Increased Reusability** - Classes can be reused in different contexts
4. **Enhanced Testability** - Classes can be tested in isolation, making unit testing easier
5. **Easier Maintenance** - Changes to one class don't affect others if interfaces remain stable
6. **Clearer Dependencies** - Dependencies between components are explicit through class relationships

## Drawbacks of Refactoring to OOP

1. **Increased Complexity** - OOP introduces additional concepts and indirection
2. **Learning Curve** - Developers need to understand OOP concepts and the specific design
3. **Potential Overengineering** - Risk of creating too many classes or overly complex hierarchies
4. **Performance Overhead** - OOP can introduce some performance overhead (though usually negligible)
5. **Refactoring Effort** - Significant effort required to refactor existing code

## Recommendation

Based on the analysis, I recommend refactoring the code to use object-oriented programming with the following approach:

1. Start with a simple class structure focusing on the core domain objects (Book)
2. Gradually refactor the procedural code into methods of appropriate classes
3. Apply design patterns where they provide clear benefits
4. Maintain backward compatibility during the refactoring process
5. Add comprehensive tests to ensure the refactored code works correctly

The benefits of improved code organization, better encapsulation, and increased reusability outweigh the drawbacks of increased complexity and refactoring effort, especially if the codebase is expected to grow or be maintained over time.
